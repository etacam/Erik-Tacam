			<h3 class = "section-heading">About Me</h3>
			<p class = "para">My name is Erik Tacam and I am a data science and political science enthusiast. I was born and raised in New York City and attended Brooklyn Technical High School. I am currently studying at Colby College, a top private liberal arts college in the Northeastern part of the United States. At Colby, I study computer science and government, along with a minor in mathematics. With the combination of my interests, I inspire to have a career in technology policy.<br>
			<br>
			On campus, I have been part of the leadership team for two new clubs - the Colby Lions Club and the Colby Cyber Security Club. In 2018, I became the co-founder and vice-president of the Colby Lions Club. The purpose of the club is to be an on-campus branch of the Waterville Lions Club in order to better coordinate volunteering activities for the Colby community to participate in Waterville. As vice-president, I was able to coordinate a fundraising event that yielded $1,300 to sponsor a 14-year old girl's education in Zimbabwe. In the same year, I became a board member of the Colby Cyber Security Club. The purpose of the club is to teach cybersecurity lessons to the Colby community. As a board member, I helped to coordinate hackathons and conferences for the club members to partake in and taught monthly cybersecurity lessons in club meetings.<br>
			<br>
			When I am not busy doing schoolwork, I like to travel, hike, and camp with my friends in the beautiful landscape of Maine. Maine's landscape is unmatched and offers a lot of hiking and camping opportunities. During the winter season, I like to go alpine skiing at Sugarloaf Mountain. Moreover, I like to play soccer with my friends as well as watch movies and documentaries.<img class = "img-responsive" img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/d9Zej2gLnUB5O0kRn4/giphy.gif" alt = "" align= "right"></p>

			<h3 class = "section-heading">Experience</h3>
			<p class = "para">Besides having a few leadership roles for clubs on campus, I've been a Collections Management Assistant, Operations Assistant, student mentor, and academic mentor.<br>
			<br>
			As a Collections Management Assistant at Colby College Libraries, I am responsible for ensuring accurate coordinating and tracking in the exchange of over 500,000 available books and materials between the Colby libraries and delivering exceptional service to the Colby library patrons.<br>
			<br>As an Operations Assistant for the Colby College Mathematics and Statistics Department, I managed department operations by ensuring collaborative work and learning spaces are ready for use by students and that faculty can focus on research and teaching responsibilities. I was also trusted to carryout time sensitive and confidential tasks to support administrative staff.<br>
			<br>
			I am a student mentor for a fourth-grade student at Winslow Elementary School where I am responsible for helping the student improve his literacy skills by fostering an adult friendship.<br>
			<br>
			As an academic mentor for two incoming first-year students, I was responsible for helping to facilitate their transitions into a new academic life at Colby College.</p>

			<h3 class = "section-heading">Travels</h3>
			<p class = "para">Over the past year, I have been fortunate enough to travel around the world to strengthen my academic background. In January 2019, I traveled to Uganda as part of a one-month study abroad program where I had the opportunity to explore international and local models of development. Throughout the month, I visited various development projects and met with aid and development professionals to understand challenges development actors face. For the fall semester of my junior year, I went to study abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark. Throughout the semester, I learned about humaniarian law and armed conflict. The focus of the program was to have an understanding of the international law regulation of armed conflict - including humanitarian law, human rights law and international criminal law. The knowledge was achieved by studying a number of contemporary case studies with a specific emphasis on Kosovo. As part of the program, I went to Kosovo for a week to learn more about the post-conflict humanitarian crisis that the nation is currently facing after becoming an independent nation in 2008.<br>
			<br>
			Besides traveling around the world to strengthen my academic background, I traveled to new cities to explore new cultures, architectual styles, and foods. By far, my favorite city that I visited in Europe was Prague. The architectural style of Old Europe, the food, and the people were amazing and distinguishably unique from the rest of Europe. I would definitely recommend that anyone should visit Prague if given the opportunity to do so. Besides Prague, I visited other beautiful cities such as Barcelona, Lisbon, and London. To the right are a few pictures of my travel adventures.</p>
